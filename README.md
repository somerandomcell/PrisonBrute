Bash
üìñ Usage
The basic syntax is:
./PrisonBrute.sh <protocol> <target> <user_source> <pass_source> [port] [options]
Use code with caution.
Bash
Or if installed globally:
prisonbrute <protocol> <target> <user_source> <pass_source> [port] [options]
Use code with caution.
Bash
üìú Arguments Explained
<protocol> (Required)
The service you want to attack.
Examples: ssh, ftp, http-get, https-get, http-form, https-form, smb, rdp, telnet, vnc, mysql, postgres.
This is passed directly to hydra, so any service hydra supports by name can be used.
<target> (Required)
The IP address or hostname of the target machine/service.
Example: 192.168.1.101, example.com.
<user_source> (Required, unless -C is used)
Can be a single username (e.g., admin) or the path to a file containing a list of usernames (one per line).
Example: root, users.txt.
<pass_source> (Required, unless -C is used)
Can be a single password (e.g., password123) or the path to a file containing a list of passwords (one per line).
Example: P@$$wOrd, rockyou.txt.
[port] (Optional)
The specific port number for the service if it's not running on its default port.
If omitted, hydra will use the default port for the specified protocol.
Example: 2222 (for SSH on a non-standard port).
‚öôÔ∏è Core Speed & Brute-Force Options
-t <tasks>:
Number of parallel connection attempts (threads) hydra will use.
Default: 64.
Higher values mean faster attempts but can overwhelm the target or your network.
‚ö†Ô∏è Use high values with extreme caution!
Example: -t 128
-w <seconds>:
Wait time in seconds (can be decimal, e.g., 0.5) between connection attempts per thread.
Default: 0 (or hydra's internal default, effectively meaning as fast as possible per thread).
Useful for evading simple rate-limiting or reducing load on the target.
Example: -w 1
-x <min:max:charset>:
Engages hydra's password generation feature.
min: Minimum password length.
max: Maximum password length.
charset: Characters to use.
a: Lowercase letters
A: Uppercase letters
1: Numbers
Special characters can be listed directly (e.g., @#$).
Example: -x 3:5:a1 (generates passwords of 3 to 5 characters using lowercase letters and numbers).
Note: When using -x, <pass_source> is ignored for password generation.
‚ú® Other Useful Options
-f:
Stop the attack as soon as the first valid credential pair is found.
Useful if you only need one point of entry.
-C <file>:
Use a colon-separated username:password file (combo list).
If this option is used, <user_source> and <pass_source> arguments are ignored.
Example: -C credentials.txt where credentials.txt contains lines like admin:password123.
-e <n|s|r>:
Perform additional checks:
n: Try null/empty password.
s: Try password same as username.
r: Try reversed username as password.
Can be combined: -e ns
Example: -e ns
-v / -V:
Control hydra's verbosity.
-v: Verbose mode.
-V: Very Verbose mode (shows individual login attempts).
PrisonBrute defaults to -V if neither is specified, to provide attack feedback.
üåê HTTP(S) Form Specific Arguments
When using http-form or https-form, you need to provide additional arguments after the main ones but before any optional port or - options. The order is important:
/<path_to_form> (Required for forms)
The URL path to the login form page on the target server.
Must start with /.
Example: /login.php, /admin/index.html
"<form_parameters>" (Required for forms)
A quoted string defining the POST request parameters.
Use ^USER^ as a placeholder for the username.
Use ^PASS^ as a placeholder for the password.
Find these by inspecting the login form's HTML source or a captured login request (e.g., with Burp Suite or browser developer tools).
Example: "username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&loginsubmit=Login"
"<failure_string>" (Required for forms)
A quoted string that uniquely appears on the page ONLY when a login attempt FAILS.
Hydra uses this to determine unsuccessful attempts.
This is crucial and often requires careful inspection of failed login responses.
Example: "Invalid username or password", "Login incorrect"
Example http-form command structure:
./PrisonBrute.sh http-form example.com users.txt passwords.txt /auth/login.aspx "user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^&btnSubmit=Sign In" "Authentication failed"
Use code with caution.
Bash
üí° Examples
SSH attack with a user list and password list, 100 tasks, stopping on first find:
./PrisonBrute.sh ssh 192.168.0.42 userlist.txt passlist.txt -t 100 -f
Use code with caution.
Bash
FTP attack against a specific user on a non-standard port:
./PrisonBrute.sh ftp 10.10.10.50 johndoe common_passwords.txt 2121
Use code with caution.
Bash
HTTP GET Basic Authentication:
./PrisonBrute.sh http-get protected.example.com admins.txt top1000pass.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
HTTP POST Form attack (DVWA example - might need CSRF handling for real DVWA):
./PrisonBrute.sh http-form 192.168.1.123 users.txt pass.txt /dvwa/login.php "username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login" "Login failed"
Use code with caution.
Bash
Note: Real-world web form brute-forcing can be complex due to CSRF tokens, captchas, JavaScript, etc. PrisonBrute provides the basic hydra structure; manual hydra tweaking might be needed for advanced forms.
SMB attack using a combo list:
./PrisonBrute.sh smb 192.168.1.200 ignored_user ignored_pass -C smb_creds.txt
# smb_creds.txt contains:
# administrator:Password123
# shareuser:backup@pass
Use code with caution.
Bash
RDP attack with 32 tasks:
./PrisonBrute.sh rdp 172.16.30.5 rdp_users.txt winter2023_pass.txt -t 32
Use code with caution.
Bash
MySQL attack trying null password and password same as user:
./PrisonBrute.sh mysql db.internal.lan root common_db_passwords.txt -e ns
Use code with caution.
Bash
üìà Output
Found credentials will be printed to the console upon discovery.
All successfully found credentials are also logged to pb_found_credentials.txt in the directory where PrisonBrute is run. The format is similar to hydra's standard output file.
üö® Warnings & Best Practices
üõë ETHICAL USE ONLY: Only attack systems you have explicit permission to test.
üê¢ START SLOW: When unsure about a target, start with a low number of tasks (-t 4 or -t 8) and gradually increase if the target is stable and not blocking you.
‚è≥ ACCOUNT LOCKOUTS: Be aware of account lockout policies on the target system. Too many failed attempts can disable accounts.
üö´ IDS/IPS/WAFs: Modern security systems can detect and block brute-force attempts. Consider using techniques like proxy rotation (if hydra supports it for the module) or slower, more targeted attacks.
üìö WORDLISTS ARE KEY: The success of a brute-force attack heavily depends on the quality of your username and password lists. Use common lists (SecLists is a great resource) and tailor them to your target if possible.
üîé VERIFY FINDINGS: Always manually verify any credentials found by PrisonBrute to ensure they are accurate and provide the expected level of access.
